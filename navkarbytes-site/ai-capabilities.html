    <h1>AI Capabilities & Systems</h1>
    <p>
      This page reflects how we think about designing, evaluating,
      and applying AI systems in real-world environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a product catalogue.
      It is a window into our advisory thinking, system design approach,
      and applied experimentation.
    </p>

<!-- ADVISORY -->
<section id="advisory">
  <h2>Advisory Perspective</h2>
  <p>
    AI success depends far more on judgment than on tooling.
    Our advisory lens focuses on deciding where AI fits,
    why it creates value, and how it should be governed.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>When AI is the right solution — and when it isn’t</li>
    <li>How to avoid automation without accountability</li>
    <li>How to align AI systems with business ownership</li>
    <li>How to introduce AI without operational fragility</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    Strong AI systems begin with strong judgment.
  </div>
</section>
<!-- OPERATING MODELS -->
<section id="operating-models">
  <h2>AI Operating Models & Control Layers</h2>


<p>This page is for leaders evaluating AI at a system level — not tools, demos, or shortcuts.</p>

  <p>
    As AI systems move from experimentation to enterprise use,
    the primary challenge shifts from model capability
    to <strong>control, accountability, and execution boundaries</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our work is informed by a set of operating concepts
    that help organisations deploy AI without losing governance.
  </p>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <strong>AIOO — AI Operating Organization</strong>
      <p>
        AIOO describes how AI capabilities are owned, governed,
        and integrated across business, technology, and risk functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It clarifies decision rights, escalation paths,
        and accountability as AI systems gain autonomy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <strong>AI Control Plane</strong>
      <p>
        The Control Plane is a non-bypassable layer
        that governs how AI systems are invoked, monitored,
        constrained, and audited at runtime.
      </p>
      <p>
        It separates probabilistic intelligence
        from deterministic execution.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <strong>Execution Control & Guardrails</strong>
      <p>
        As AI agents act on real systems,
        execution must be bounded by policy,
        validation, and human override mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Guardrails are designed into execution —
        not retrofitted after incidents.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <strong>Orchestration vs Execution Boundaries</strong>
      <p>
        Orchestration coordinates intent and flow.
        Execution performs irreversible actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treating these as separate layers
        is essential for safe, scalable AI systems.

<!-- INSIGHTS -->
<section id="insights">
  <h2>Insights from Applied Work</h2>

  <p>
    Across advisory engagements and experiments,
    certain patterns consistently emerge:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Most AI failures are architectural, not model-related</li>
    <li>Governance cannot be retrofitted successfully</li>
    <li>Agent autonomy must be explicitly bounded</li>
    <li>Human-in-the-loop design is a strength, not a weakness</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These insights inform our guidance long before systems are built.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- BOUNDARY -->
<section>
  <div class="boundary">
    <h3>What This Is Not</h3>
    <p>
      This page is not a promise of instant results,
      a list of off-the-shelf tools,
      or an argument that AI belongs everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI systems succeed only when grounded in real operations and accountability.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- SERVICES / ENGAGEMENTS -->
<section id="services">
  <h2>How This Translates into Engagements</h2>

  <p>
    Our AI work typically shows up in three forms:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Advisory discussions on AI readiness and direction</li>
    <li>Architecture and governance design support</li>
    <li>Guided experimentation to inform larger decisions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We usually begin with conversation and framing —
    not with building or selling tools.
  </p>
