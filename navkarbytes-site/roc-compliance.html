    <h1>ROC Compliance Is About Staying Clean — Not Chasing Deadlines</h1>

    <p>
      Annual and ongoing ROC compliance exists to keep your company
      legally clean and operationally stable.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Most compliance stress happens when filings are treated as
      one-time tasks instead of an ongoing system.</strong>

  <h2>Why Companies Get ROC Compliance Wrong</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>They assume compliance starts only when revenue grows</li>
    <li>They miss early filings thinking they are “not important”</li>
    <li>They rely on reminders instead of planning</li>
    <li>They react only after notices arrive</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    ROC penalties are rarely sudden — they accumulate quietly over time.

  <h2>The Right Way to Think About Compliance</h2>

  <div class="decision-box">
    <p><strong>Reactive compliance</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Track deadlines late</li>
      <li>File under pressure</li>
      <li>Pay avoidable penalties</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Structured compliance</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Know what applies to your company</li>
      <li>Plan filings annually</li>
      <li>Execute calmly and consistently</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What ROC Compliance Typically Includes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Annual ROC filings</li>
    <li>Director-related filings</li>
    <li>Event-based filings (changes, resolutions)</li>
    <li>Maintaining statutory records</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Applicability varies by company type and activity.
    Not everything applies to everyone.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Sometimes the Problem Is Not Non-Compliance — It’s Confusion</h2>

  <p>
    Many businesses are technically compliant but unsure.
    Others assume compliance is “handled” when it is not.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    We focus on clarity first — so compliance stops feeling fragile.

    <h2>Stay Compliant Without Stress</h2>
    <p>
      A short conversation can help you understand
      what applies, what doesn’t, and how to stay clean.
