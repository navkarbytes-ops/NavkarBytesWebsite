    <h1>Register the Right Company — Not Just Any Company</h1>

    <p>
      Confused about company registration? That’s normal.
      What matters is not how fast you register —
      but whether you choose the <strong>right structure</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Company registration is not paperwork.</strong><br>
      It is the first irreversible decision in a business journey.
    </p>

    <div class="cta-box">

      <p>

<!-- WHY YOU ARE HERE -->
<section>
  <h2>You’re Not Alone in This Decision</h2>

  <p>
    It’s common to feel unsure at this stage.
    Most founders don’t know which company type fits their situation —
    and that’s okay.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re here, you’re probably asking:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Should I register an LLP or a Private Limited company?</li>
    <li>Do I really need a company right now?</li>
    <li>What will compliance look like after registration?</li>
    <li>Am I locking myself into something hard to change?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>These are not Google questions.</strong><br>
    They are business decisions.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- DECISION ORDER -->
<section>
  <h2>The Order Matters</h2>

  <div class="decision-box">
    <p>
      Most long-term problems happen when founders:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Register first</li>
      <li>Figure out compliance later</li>
      <li>Struggle with costs and complexity over time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We reverse the order:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clarify what you’re building</li>
      <li>Decide the right structure</li>
      <li>Register with context and confidence</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- WHEN NOT TO REGISTER -->
<section>
  <h2>You May Not Need to Register Yet</h2>

  <p>
    Registering early is not always the smart move.
    You may not need a company yet if:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>You are still validating an idea</li>
    <li>There is no revenue or legal liability yet</li>
    <li>You don’t need contracts, invoicing, or partners</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    We will tell you honestly if waiting or choosing a simpler setup
    is the better decision right now.
  </div>
</section>

<!-- CONSEQUENCES -->
<section>
  <h2>The Cost of the Wrong Structure</h2>

  <p>
    Choosing the wrong company type usually doesn’t hurt immediately.
    The cost shows up months later —
    in compliance effort, taxation, operational friction,
    and difficulty changing course.
  </p>

  <p>
    A short conversation before registration
    can prevent years of unnecessary complexity.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- AFTER REGISTRATION -->
<section>
  <h2>Registration Is Just the Beginning</h2>

  <p>
    Most platforms stop once the certificate is issued.
    We don’t.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Post-registration compliance guidance</li>
    <li>GST and statutory registrations</li>
    <li>Operational and documentation structure</li>
    <li>Clarity on next steps as the business grows</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- FINAL CTA -->
<section>
  <div class="final-cta">
    <h2>Start Right. Stay Right.</h2>
    <p>
      The right structure today saves time, money,
      and unnecessary rework tomorrow.
