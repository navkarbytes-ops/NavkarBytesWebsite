    <h1>AI Consulting & Architecture</h1>

    <p>
      AI adoption is no longer about finding the right model.
      It is about making the right decisions — early, deliberately,
      and in alignment with how your business actually operates.
    </p>

    <p>
      We help organisations understand where AI fits,
      where it doesn’t, and how to apply it responsibly
      without creating technical or operational risk.
    </p>
	
	<p>
	This is not for teams looking to “add AI” without ownership, governance, and accountability.
	</p>

<!-- PROBLEM FRAMING -->
<section>
  <h2>Why Many AI Initiatives Stall</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Tools and platforms are chosen before problems are defined</li>
    <li>Proofs of concept never transition into production</li>
    <li>Ownership between business, data, and engineering is unclear</li>
    <li>Governance, reliability, and accountability are afterthoughts</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    Most AI failures are not technical.
    They are architectural and organisational.
  </div>
</section>

<!-- WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE -->
<section>
  <h2>What Effective AI Adoption Looks Like</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Clear business objectives before automation or modelling</li>
    <li>Architectures that support scale, control, and auditability</li>
    <li>Defined human-in-the-loop and decision boundaries</li>
    <li>Integration with existing workflows and systems</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applied Systems & Capabilities</h2>

  <p>
    For teams that want to explore how these ideas translate into
    real systems, architectures, and experiments,
    we also share examples of the kinds of AI capabilities we work with.
