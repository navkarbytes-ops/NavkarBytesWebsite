    <h1>Advisory & Architecture</h1>
    <p>
      Strong execution depends on strong decisions.
      We help organisations make the right structural choices
      before committing time, capital, or technology.
    </p>
    
	<p>
	Most execution problems are not execution problems.
    They are decision problems that surface too late.
	</p>
	
	<p>
      Our advisory work spans business structure, compliance,
      and AI architecture — with a focus on control, sequencing,
      and long-term sustainability.

  <h2>How We Think About Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    Architecture is not just technical design.
    It is about defining boundaries, ownership,
    and decision rights before systems scale.
  </p>
  <p>
    This philosophy applies equally to business compliance
    and to AI systems operating in production environments.

    <h2>Discuss Your Next Structural Decision</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you are structuring a company
      or evaluating AI adoption,
      clarity early prevents expensive rework later.
